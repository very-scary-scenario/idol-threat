## earth_blur

It's the year 20XX.
After a gruelling war against an otherworldly threat, Earth is in a state of recovery.
A time of reflection, repair and respite.
With a sombre mood permeating the planet, the populace turns to young entertainers to raise their spirits.

## office_bloom

This is the story of an idol unit that conquered the world.
With love.
And also music.
Our unit's humble beginning is in an office building in central Shin Tokyo.
It still lays in a state of disrepair following the attack, but it'll have to do.
People are desperate for encouragement from local idols, and you can't do that if the dances are sloppy.
So, if this idol unit is to be successful, they must first learn from the girls that came before them.
Fortunately for us, there's a local group available that can teach our girls in a hands-on way.

### boss_01_3 enter, from right, into right

### boss_01_2 enter, into middle

...
...
boss_01_2:: "I thought so."
### clear
Charming.
This may just be the beginning, but our idol unit has what it takes to unite the world with cheer.
The quickest way to the top is to learn from those with similar aspirations, however...
...they are also our rivals, and they're standing in the way of this dream.
They must fight.

> battle 0: boss_01_1, boss_01_2, boss_01_3

With the rival unit defeated, our heroes have taken their first steps towards saving the world.
Thank you, senpais.
Your spirits will live on in the new generation.

# part two

## office_bloom

After learning some dance routines from the internet and squeezing in some karaoke sessions, our unit is ready for their stage debut.
From there we can show the rest of Shin Tokyo that their saviours have arrived.
To move forward they must perform at local venues, slowly working their way up the idol food chain.
Local venues with their tiny stages.
Sticky floors.
Cigarette stains.
...
Sigh.
But in these trying times, we must all make sacrifices.

## small_stage_bloom

It's 6pm. The local venue, Angel Sparkling Dream, is soon to open its doors for tonight's performance.
There's another idol group on the cards, but we should be able to convince them to give up their spot. 
### boss_02_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_02_2:: "Who the heck are these clowns?"
boss_02_2:: "Security!"
### boss_02_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_02_1:: "Hey what's up"
### boss_02_2
boss_02_2:: "Not you, idiot. You don't even have a suit or a clipboard."
boss_02_2:: "SECURITY!"
### boss_02_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_02_3:: "I'm here!"
boss_02_2:: "You're barely an idol, let alone security."
boss_02_2:: "Honestly, where the heck are they?"
boss_02_3:: "On a date, boss. Nice place by the river."
boss_02_2:: "Phenomenal. It's lucky we're not paying them a wage."
boss_02_2:: "Looks like we'll be throwing you out this time."
This is our chance to catch a big break, and one that our heroes so desperately need.
Idols! Remove that rival unit from their own gig and claim your rightful place as the hope of Shin Tokyo!

> battle 50: boss_02_1, boss_02_2, boss_02_3

With the rival unit defeated, it's now up to us to achieve their dream.
It's quite beautiful, really. Dreams passing from one group of idols to another.
Even with the mess.
As crowds of people filter into the venue, they seem surprised to see a different idol group on the stage.
But surprise quickly turns to acceptance, as they wave their approval through the medium of glowstick.

# part three

## small_stage_bloom

While leaving the venue, the idols are approached by someone in a business suit.
They wanted to know if you'd seen the idols that were meant to be performing tonight.
Having no idea what they're talking about, it seems like you aren't going to be of much use.
A brief glance behind the stage leaves them optionless, and it's decided that they will help our idols instead.
Not only do they have contacts at the Shin Nippon Budokan, the most important stage in the country,
but they'll also help with the cleaning! Score!
Seriously, when it comes to removing stains from your costume's frills, you take all the help you can get.
There is a condition, however.

## jp_alley_blur

Our idols are introduced to another local unit. One that seems to know the person in the business suit. 
### boss_03_3 enter, from left, into middle
boss_03_3:: "Hey, back off. This person belongs to us."
### boss_03_2 enter, from left, into left
boss_03_2:: "We won them in an idol-off in the streets."
boss_03_2:: "We own them and their next two generations."
### boss_03_1 enter, from right, into right
boss_03_1:: "We don't know much about them, but the suit makes us seem more important."
boss_03_3:: "Now, how about some compensation?"
boss_03_3:: "You know, for the emotional trauma you've caused us today."
To win the help of this suit, our idols must demonstrate what the opportunity means to them.
The two groups dust down their clothes, assume their fighting stances and prepare for battle.

> battle 50: boss_03_2, boss_03_3, boss_03_1

With the battle won, our idols are one step closer to conquering the world.
With love, sparkles and all that good stuff.
Business Suit seems irritated that the other unit didn't try to learn their name,
but concludes that we are probably the kinder of the two and might learn it eventually.
With the dreams and aspirations of three rival idol units inside them, it's time to head to the Shin Nippon Budokan. 

# part four

## budokan_glow

Business Suit proves to be a great asset almost immediately, gaining the idols access to the Shin Nippon Budokan.
Under regular circumstances we'd have to spend more time at smaller venues, making a name for ourselves.
But we already know that these idols are going to become the saviours of the world,
so it's not really our fault that the guards don't stand a chance against a powerful chop to the neck.
As our group approaches the stage, a famous idol unit slowly comes into view.
It's them.
The most popular idols in all of Shin Japan.
They aren't like the idols we've met before. Their overwhelming presence is felt immediately from across the corridor.
What's worse is that they know why our unit is here.
### boss_04_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_04_2:: "Another one? Seriously, these guards are an embarrassment to the Shin Budokan."
The leader of the group, without breaking eye contact with our idols, tightens the bow under her collar.
### boss_04_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_04_1:: "It's no bother, I could use a warm up before this evening's performance."
This one pats her mouth gently with a tissue. It appears we're not the first to challenge them today.
### boss_04_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_04_3:: "These ones don't even look like idols."
...
Unforgivable.
We can't rush this. That they are still hungry for battle is testament to their strength.
It's going to be a tough fight, but we're fighting for the fate of Shin Japan.
Don't back down.
Don't give up.
Show them your appeal!

> battle 50: boss_04_1, boss_04_2, boss_04_3

We're unstoppable.
With the power of Shin Japan's greatest idols, few can stand a chance against our unit.
You will be entertained.
However, this is raw, untamed power. 
We may have conquered Japan, but the whole world is currently out of the question.
With her dying breath, one of the Budokan idols begins to speak.
### boss_04_2 enter, from left, into middle, rotated left
boss_04_2:: "You'll never make it. You don't stand a chance against the IIA".
...
...
...
boss_04_2:: "The IIA, you idiots. The International Idol Association".
She pauses briefly to cough up blood. 
boss_04_2:: "If you're to succeed, you must first defeat the three representatives of the IIA".
With that, she slumps to one side.
Thank you for your help, idol-san. Your unique flavour will never be forgotten.

# part five

## shrine_bloom

Fortunately for our heroes, it would not be long before the IIA made themselves known.
As the idols left the Budokan, the earth began to shake.
With a grand plume of fire, three masked figures appear before us.
### boss_05_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_05_2:: "We are the IIA representatives for Asia."
### boss_05_3 enter, from left, into left
boss_05_3:: "We have been watching, and we have decided to stop you here."
### boss_05_1 enter, from right, into right
boss_05_1:: "As representatives of the IIA."
boss_05_3:: "Basically we're a big deal."
It's not clear what the IIA is, but-
boss_05_1:: "We're the..."
boss_05_3:: "International!"
boss_05_2:: "Idol!"
### celebrate
boss_05_3, boss_05_2, boss_05_1:: "Association!"
...
It appears our opponents are performing some kind of death ritual.
However, as dangerous as it may be, consuming the experiences of an idol unit of this level would prove invaluable.
We need to win now, when it really counts. Let's show them the power of Shin Japanese audio engineering.
...for the sake of the world!

> battle 50: boss_05_1, boss_05_2, boss_05_3

With the IIA representatives for Asia defeated, our idols are now the strongest in the entire continent.
All of it! Even the small, boring parts.
But that's, like, not even most of the world.
Yes, legend tells of distant lands outside of Asia. Lands incomparable to Shin Japan.
America. 
Europe.
America and Europe.
Our idols can't obtain their dream of uniting the world while there are members of the IIA still around to stop them.
We must bring the fight to them.
Business Suit schedules a flight, marking the beginning of our search for the European IIA representatives.

# part six

## VSS02

Europe, the gigantic country to the west, is first on the list.
The plane journey has been largely uneventful, but I can't say the same for the in-flight meal.
It's a Japanese meal, largely made up of sushi in a variety of styles. An extravagant selection with inspired ingredients.

## maki_blur

The first set of rolls flaunted delicate slices of lightly seasoned bluefin tuna, complimented by a drizzling of toasted sesame seeds. The crisp nori seaweed added a delicate resistance to the piece.

## nigiri_blur

These were followed by a platter of king salmon nigiri, polished by a thin glaze of mizkan vinegar. This mingled exquisitely with a mildly spiced mayonnaise, daringly placed beneath the fish. 
However, it's this final pair that will leave a lasting impression. 

## avocado_blur

The outstanding composition of tender avocado, restrained almost sexually to a bed of rice, truly set the dish apart from all others like it.
That's right.

## VSS01

A completely inedible lunch for an idol unit that doesn't eat seafood.
Never trust a fish. These are words that the agency will live and die by.
Fortunately the disappointment is momentary, as the flight to Europe proves to be a short one. We have arrived.

## norway_blur

As our idols step off the plane, the European IIA representatives step out from behind a truck.
### boss_06_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_06_2:: "At last, we have found you. Welcome to Norway!"
### boss_06_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_06_1:: "Velkommen!"
### boss_06_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_06_3:: "Ni hao!"
The European IIA's attempt to lull our heroes into a false sense of security hasn't worked.
We know we're in Europe, not Norway.
Insulted by this cheap trick, our idols prepare for combat.

> battle 50: boss_06_1, boss_06_2, boss_06_3

A lot of time was wasted in the battle with the European representatives.
With that in mind, it's imperative that the American IIA representatives are found as soon as possible.
The immediacy? Well, I suppose it isn't immediate per se...
But the sooner we kill the American representatives, the sooner we can unite the world!
Kill their spirits, I mean. It's complicated.
Fortunately a plane won't be necessary this time, as America is easily within driving distance.
Our idols can spend the journey reflecting on battles past, preparing themselves for a life of fame and entertainment.

# part seven

## coach_blur

The drive was arduous.
There were mountains, rivers, and even deserts
on the Wikipedia page, but it turns out you can just take the highway straight to America. 
The traffic was awful though, which put a slight dampener on the mood.
Our idols have had time to come to terms with the reality of their situation.
They had a humble beginning on the streets of Shin Tokyo, performing here and there to make a few Shin bucks. 
Now, as far as the plot is concerned, they're number two in the entire world.
The entire world.
They've learned all that there is to learn. Right now, the American IIA members are a mere roadblock on their inevitable rise to the top.
It's time to solve this.

## western_blur

We're here. We've arrived at the American capital.
This isn't really what the idols had pictured the capital would look like. They were expecting something less modern.
Our car comes to a complete stop outside a nearby dusty saloon. 
There are horses tied up by the watering hole, and some local kids are playing music on their mobile phones.
The saloon doors swing open to reveal a trio of girls wearing cowboy hats, pistols on their hips and snarls to match the mood.
It appears that even America has cosplay idols.
### boss_07_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_07_2:: "Yer done did it now, pardner"
### boss_07_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_07_1:: "Gon dun in them Norway lasses they did."
### boss_07_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_07_3:: "Darn tootin'."
When the diplomatic talks with the European idols broke down, we'd hoped to at least make progress with the Americans.
But we were not prepared for them to speak such a bizarre language. The talks are off.
We must be cautious, however. This is our biggest hurdle thus far.
End them, and our heroes will be the strongest idol unit in the world!

> battle 50: boss_07_1, boss_07_2, boss_07_3

Victory is ours!
We are the strongest idol unit in the world!
Maybe even the universe!
With the IIA defeated, we've finally achieved our dream of bringing joy to the world.
Congratulations.
The end.
Fini.
Endo.
...
What's that? The world needs to hear our idols perform?
Ah well, yeah. I suppose so. If you want.
Like, hurry up though because we've got to have celebrations and stuff.

# part eight

## large_stage_bloom

To mark the defeat of the IIA and a revolution in worldwide idoling, we're holding a celebratory live performance.
A grand stage has been constructed especially. Finally, a good use of taxpayer's money.
It also comes equipped with speakers the size of small nations, just to make sure that everyone can hear the idols sing.
Dead or alive.
Perhaps this explains the appearance of three ghosts, who seem slightly concerned about something.
They look scary, but they were polite enough to wait until we were done admiring the stage.
### boss_08_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_08_2:: "Stop... Ya murderin' vermint..."
### boss_08_3 enter, from left, into left
boss_08_3:: "I don't know what she just said..."
### boss_08_1 enter, from right, into right
boss_08_1:: "I can't feel my legs and I'm freaking out right now..."
Even now, the ex-leaders of the IIA representatives have the gall to call you a murderer.
It's not your fault that they had a weak constitution.
boss_08_3:: "You're both as bad as each other..."
boss_08_2:: "Why did I hav ter die..."
boss_08_1:: "We'll bring you down with us..."
I have no idea what they're talking about and honestly I'm both shocked and appalled. 
It's time to end this, once and for all.

> battle 50: boss_08_1, boss_08_2, boss_08_3

If there was any doubt about the abilities of the world's strongest idol unit, just remember
they just killed three ghosts.
To celebrate this moment, we should have our idols raise their glowsticks in the air.
You know, because it seems like an idol-y thing to do.
And it might make for a good album cover or something.
...
That's right! Just like that!
Hold that pose!

# part nine

## large_stage_bloom

Our idols have raised their glowsticks into the air.
At first, it doesn't seem all that strange, but something started to happen after twenty minutes or so.
The clouds above the stage began to swirl, eventually parting to reveal a flying object of unidentified origin.
The underside of the ship opens up, and with a quick flash, the idols were no longer on Earth.

## earth_blur

Finally, my plan is complete!
With the world's strongest idols defeated, I'm free to conquer Earth.
That's right, it's me! The narrator!
You may have thought that you'd won the previous war, but the truth is...
we let you win.
With the world in this weakened state, we have been free to build a super weapon.
A weapon unlike anything you've ever seen before!
### boss_09_2 enter, from left, into middle

boss_09_3:: "Hello."
boss_09_3:: "I too am a weapon, but you may recognise me from the 1997 hit comedy Flubber."
boss_09_3:: "The pleasure's all mine."
How do you like that! I bet you can't help but be shocked!
These weapons have the power to wipe out your planet before you can even say goodbye to it.
And there's literally nothing you can do about it.
You've done me a great service, taking care of the only idol groups that would have posed us much of a threat.
For that, you have my thanks.
It's time we make idols an extinct species, starting with your precious little group!

> battle 50: boss_09_1, boss_09_2, boss_09_3

No! This cannot be!
Have I... Have I created a monster unit?
The Strongest Idols in the Universe™?
...
...
...
Ahahaha! 
Of course not.
What you defeated were simply a mass-produced alien idol unit, one of millions we have prepared for destroying your planet.
That, and you ate them! 
Honestly, did you not think the whole cannibalism thing was a bit weird?
Anyway, you're finished! There's nothing left that you can do! 
Come with me. 
I'll permit you to watch the end of Earth before I finish you off.

The sun is no longer an alien spaceship, but the star it used to be.
Because I've decided to return it to its prior form.
The aliens no longer exist.
Because I've decided that they don't. 
The people we killed along the way are alive again.

It's done. 
My power is gone, and my story is over. 
Well, perhaps not. This might be punishment for what has happened on this journey.
Because I recognise the two girls who are also here. 
They look different from how they did in our final fight, but I know it's them.
Ha! 
So this is how it is!
After what I've done, I can't complain. 
Let's see this to its conclusion. I've seen this enough to know what I have to say.
...
Ahem.
"What's this? Another fledgling idol group to cut down?"

We interrupt this regularly scheduled canonical ending to bring you a bonus round!
Our story may have concluded several times, but that's not going to stop us.
And it's not just because we have some extra art to use up.
These warriors are more formidable than any that you have fought up to this point.
They have each harnessed the power of moe, their spirits teeming with raw energy.
Plus they have adorable Christmas outfits, so that's pretty cool.

The alien threat has been thwarted once again.
It came at the great cost of our lives.
Earth saw a brief period of peace
before everyone died when the sun returned to its home planet.
The end.

bodytype_part_col_no(_pose)
1_hb_1_1(_1)

All body types should match (though thats more about head positioning, and we only have one anyway...)
Pose needs to match for body and clothes (both parts)
colour needs to match for body and head
colour needs to match for hair back and hair front. Maybe also both extras and ahoge, though it'd probably be funny to mix those up...
